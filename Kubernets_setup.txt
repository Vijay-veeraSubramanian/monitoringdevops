Prerequisites:
Before we start with the installation process, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
A server running Ubuntu 20.04 with at least 2 CPU cores and 4GB of RAM.
A non-root user with sudo privileges.
Docker installed on the server.

sudo swapoff -a


Step 1: Update the system
The first step is to update the Ubuntu system to the latest version. Run the following command to update the system:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
Step 2: Install kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl

Next, we will install kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl. These are the essential components of Kubernetes. Run the following command to install them:

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
EOF
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl

Step 3: Initialize Kubernetes
After installing the Kubernetes components, we need to initialize the cluster using kubeadm. Run the following command to initialize the cluster:

sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=192.168.0.0/16
Note down the kubeadm join command that appears at the end of the output. You will need it to join worker nodes to the cluster.

Step 4: Configure kubectl
After initializing the cluster, we need to configure kubectl to communicate with the Kubernetes API server. Run the following commands to do so:

mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
Step 5: Install a Pod network add-on
To communicate between containers running on different nodes in the cluster, we need to install a Pod network add-on. Run the following command to install Calico:

kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml
Step 6: Join worker nodes (Optional)
If you want to add worker nodes to the Kubernetes cluster, you can do so by running the kubeadm join command that you noted down in Step 3 on each worker node.

Step 7: Verify the installation
To verify that Kubernetes is running correctly, run the following command:

kubectl get nodes
You should see the master node and any worker nodes that you added.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Kubernetes on Ubuntu 20.04. Kubernetes is a powerful tool that can help you manage your containerized applications efficiently. If you face any issues during the installation process, refer to the official Kubernetes documentation for more information
